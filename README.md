## Issues

The task description mentioned "refactoring the HTML and JS into components". However, this was challenging because the provided source code contained only two HTML files (`example_js_generator.html` and `timedOrdersView.html`). As a result, this project was more about creating a new application based on the assignmentâ€™s screenshot rather than refactoring the existing code. Nevertheless, I was able to reuse some helpful functions from `timedOrdersView.js`.
